# SuiteSparse.py

Cython/Python interface to [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).

You can use any library that implements sparse matrices but :program:`SuiteSparse.py` is really well 
integrated with [CySparse](https://github.com/PythonOptimizers/cysparse).

## Announcements

## Dependencies

Althought :program:`SuiteSparse.py` has been optimized to use sparse matrices from [CySparse](https://github.com/PythonOptimizers/cysparse), 
you don't have to install :program:`CySparse`!
